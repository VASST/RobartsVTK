# Development Process

We follow the github model of development, where a developer will create an issue, create a branch suitably named for that issue, commit changes to that branch, push the branch to the repository, and then finally create a pull request to merge that branch into the master.

We will evaluate the merge request and then merge the changes.

# Testing Other Platforms

To test other platforms before creating the merge request, you can push a copy of your branch with the name "build-testing" and the build machines will build your branch.
