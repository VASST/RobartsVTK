// .NAME vtkEpiphanVideoSource - Epiphan Video Source for VTK (http://www.epiphan.com/products/dvi-frame-grabbers/dvi2usb-solo/)
// .SECTION Description provides an interface to Epiphan USB capture devices
//	through their API which is provided.  In order to use this class, you must link with frmgrab.lib.
//
//  Layouts can be added and removed from the screen as required but typically once they
//  are added they are left in the application.
//
// .SECTION Caveats
//  Have only tested with the DVI2USB-SOLO but should work with the other units as well.  some assumptions are made about the image size.
//	I am positive this will not compile under linux and only works/tested on windows.  The device should work with linux/mac however.  
// .SECTION see also
//  vtkVideoSource
